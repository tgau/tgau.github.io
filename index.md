# About me

As an IBM Distinguished Engineer, I transform public services and healthcare and in Germany to make the life of the involved people better.
To make that happen, I unite business and IT at government agencies, healthcare providers and insurance.
As a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) in IBM Consulting I lead top technical talents and ensure that our architectures are fit for purpose. I love to communicate complex concepts in easy words. This is why I enjoy teaching and mentoring.
